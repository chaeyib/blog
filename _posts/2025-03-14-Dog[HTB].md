## Enumeration
### Port Scan
The Enumeration process begins with Port Scan using RustScan. The command used is as follows - `rustscan --range=1-65535 -a dog.htb -- -A`
The open ports are:
```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON         VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63 OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.12 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```
The port scan results indicate that the HTTP service running on port 80 is a likely target for gaining an initial foothold.
The results also show an interesting endpoint at [*10.10.11.58:80/.git/*](http://10.10.11.58:80/.git/)
### Website
The website opens to a simple web page which has some blog-like posts with an *About* button and *Login*. Burp Suite is opened as proxy and all the traffic for the target is routed through the Burp proxy. 
![Home Page](/assets/images/htb_dog01.png){: w="700" h="400" }

A form with *username* and *password* is displayed upon clicking the *Login* button. The web page also displays *RESET PASSWORD* button.
![Login](/assets/images/htb_dog02.png){: w="700" h="400" }

The *RESET PASSWORD* has a form to input *email address* to reset the password.
![Password Reset](/assets/images/htb_dog03.png){: w="700" h="400" }

Two key observations from exploring the website are:
1. The URL scheme uses the *q* parameter to pass the path as a value. For Example - http://dog.htb/about is http://dog.htb/?q=about .
2. The application is built using *Backdrop CMS*.

## Exploitation
### User Flag
The presence of *.git/* directory at [*10.10.11.58:80/.git/*](http://10.10.11.58:80/.git/) indicates that the Git repository of the website is publicly accessible, meaning that entire source code of the website can be retrieved. [GitHack](https://github.com/lijiejie/GitHack.git) is used to do this by running `python GitHack.py http://10.10.11.58/.git` .
![Git Repo Clone](/assets/images/htb_dog04.png){: w="700" h="400" }

**Note:** Please change the machine IP according to your environment.

A password is present **settings.php** file, one of the files obtained when the Git repository is downloaded.
![Cred](/assets/images/htb_dog05.png){: w="700" h="400" }

The string "**@dog.htb**"  is used with the `grep` command to search for usernames within the Git repository. The command executed is `grep -rin "@dog.htb" . 2>/dev/null` .
![Username](/assets/images/htb_dog06.png){: w="700" h="400" }

This reveals a set of credentials that can be used to log in to the website which shows the Admin Dashboard for the Backdrop CMS.
![Admin Dashboard](/assets/images/htb_dog07.png){: w="700" h="400" }

Upon exploring further, it is shown that at [http://dog.htb/?q=admin/reports/status](http://dog.htb/?q=admin/reports/status) that Backdrop CMS version 1.27.1 is running.
![Backdrop CMS Version](/assets/images/htb_dog08.png){: w="700" h="400" }

An [Authenticated Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52021) exists in Backdrop CMS 1.27.1, which is discovered using `searchsploit backdrop`. The exploit is copied to the current directory using `searchsploit -m php/webapps/52021.py`.
![Searchsploit](/assets/images/htb_dog09.png){: w="700" h="400" }

The exploit creates module which can be installed on to the website. This module creates an endpoint where commands can be run.
![RCE Exploit](/assets/images/htb_dog10.png){: w="700" h="400" }

Since the URL provided in the exploit output is not functional, the known URL format using the *q* parameter is used to access [http://dog.htb/?q=admin/modules/install](http://dog.htb/?q=admin/modules/install). From there, the "Manual Installation" option is selected to install a module.

The last option, "Upload a module, theme, or layout archive to install", is chosen, which only accepts files with the extensions **.tar**, **.tgz**, **.gz**, or **.bz2**.
![Extension Error](/assets/images/htb_dog11.png){: w="700" h="400" }

Reviewing the exploit source code reveals that the uploaded ZIP file contains two files, **shell.info** and **shell.php**, both inside a directory named **shell**. A **.tar** archive is then created using the following command `tar -cvzf shell.tar shell/shell.` Uploading this file successfully creates an endpoint at [http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php](http://dog.htb/modules/shell/shell.php), allowing command execution.
`cat /etc/passwd` is run at the endpoint, which reveals two users - *jobert* and *johncusack* .
![/ETC/PASSWD](/assets/images/htb_dog12.png){: w="700" h="400" }

The password of *tiffany* is used with one the these users to logon to ssh and obtain the user flag.

## Privilege Escalation
`sudo` checks reveal that the low privileged user can run `/usr/local/bin/bee` with superuser (root) privileges.
![Sudo check](/assets/images/htb_dog13.png){: w="700" h="400" }

Bee is a command line utility for Backdrop CMS. Running `/usr/local/bin/bee --help` shows the help menu for bee. An interesting argument that can help with privilege escalation is discovered in the help menu.
```
eval
   ev, php-eval
   Evaluate (run/execute) arbitrary PHP code after bootstrapping Backdrop.
```

`/usr/local/bin/bee` should be run from the root directory of the Backdrop installation, or the root directory should be given in the `--root=` argument. `find / -name "settings.php" 2>/dev/null` is run to get the root directory, which is found to be **/var/www/html** .
![Backdrop CMS Root](/assets/images/htb_dog14.png){: w="700" h="400" }

The root shell is obtained by running `bee` with `sudo` to execute `bash` using `sudo /usr/local/bin/bee --root='/var/www/html/' ev 'SYSTEM("/bin/bash")'`
![Root flag](/assets/images/htb_dog15.png){: w="700" h="400" }
